<CENTER> <FONT SIZE="5"COLOR="BLACK" FACE="INK FREE"> I started my primary education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Zainab 1 and later
<br> transferred to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan Ismail in Telipot, Kota Bharu for secondary school.
<BR><BR>
Previously, I am a foundation student from UiTM Dengkil, where I completed my Foundation in Law.
And currently doing my degree in Islamic Banking. I've managed to get dean straight for 3 semester and hoping for the best for 
this current semester.
<BR><BR>
Since my school days, I have been quite passionate about calculation subject and always wanted to be a Financial Advisor at any bank especially in Kuwait Bank.
So, that's the big why I changed from my previous foundation course and decided to further my Degree in Islamic Banking. </CENTER>
